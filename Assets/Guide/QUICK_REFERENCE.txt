ENEMY AI:
- Detects player within range
- Chases player until in stopping distance
- Attacks when in range
- Cooldown between attacks

WAVE SYSTEM:

- Increasing difficulty each wave
- Spawns enemies around player at safe distance
- Waits for all enemies to be defeated before next wave


QUICK SETUP CHECKLIST
========================================
□ Add Character Controller to Player
□ Add PlayerController, PlayerHealth, PlayerCombat scripts to Player
□ Add Player Input component and connect events
□ Set Player tag to "Player"
□ Create AttackPoint child object under Player

□ Create Cinemachine Camera
□ Set Follow and LookAt to Player transform
□ Position for isometric view

□ Create Enemy with Capsule visual
□ Add Character Controller, EnemyAI, EnemyHealth to Enemy
□ Create "Enemy" layer and assign
□ Save as prefab in /Assets/Prefabs

□ Create WaveSpawner GameObject
□ Add WaveSpawner script
□ Assign Enemy prefab and Player transform

□ (Optional) Set up UI Canvas with health bar and wave text
□ (Optional) Add GameUI script and connect references


CUSTOMIZATION TIPS
========================================

FOR FASTER GAMEPLAY:
- Increase PlayerController.moveSpeed
- Increase PlayerController.rollSpeed
- Decrease attack cooldowns

FOR HARDER DIFFICULTY:
- Increase EnemyAI.moveSpeed
- Increase EnemyAI.attackDamage
- Decrease PlayerHealth.maxHealth
- Increase WaveSpawner.initialEnemiesPerWave

FOR BETTER FEEL:
- Adjust PlayerController.rotationSpeed for snappier turning
- Tweak rollDuration for quicker dodges
- Increase attackRange for more forgiving combat
- Adjust camera distance and angle to preference


DEBUGGING GIZMOS
========================================

When objects are selected in Scene view:
- PlayerCombat: Red sphere = attack range
- EnemyAI: Yellow sphere = detection range, Red sphere = attack range
- WaveSpawner: Cyan sphere = spawn radius, Green sphere = min spawn distance


COMMON ISSUES & FIXES
========================================

Player not responding to input:
→ Check Player Input component has InputSystem_Actions assigned
→ Verify events are connected to script functions
→ Ensure "Roll" action exists in Input Actions

Camera not following:
→ Verify Cinemachine Camera has Follow/LookAt set to Player
→ Check camera position isn't too far

Enemies not attacking:
→ Ensure Player has "Player" tag
→ Check enemy detection range in EnemyAI
→ Verify PlayerHealth component exists on Player

Can't hit enemies:
→ Create and assign "Enemy" layer
→ Set Enemy GameObjects to Enemy layer
→ Select Enemy layer in PlayerCombat.enemyLayer

Roll not working:
→ Add "Roll" action to InputSystem_Actions
→ Bind to Left Shift (or desired key)
→ Connect in Player Input events to PlayerController.OnRoll


NEXT DEVELOPMENT PHASES
========================================

Phase 1 (Current): Core mechanics working
Phase 2: Visual polish (particles, animations, screen shake)
Phase 3: More enemy types and variations
Phase 4: Power-ups and player progression
Phase 5: Audio (SFX and music)
Phase 6: UI polish and game flow
Phase 7: Balance and difficulty tuning
