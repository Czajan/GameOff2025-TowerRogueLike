   - Set Follow Target to Player in Inspector
   - Script will configure Position/Rotation Composer settings


PHASE 3: ENEMY SETUP
========================================

1. CREATE ENEMY PREFAB

   - Set to apply to children when prompted

4. SAVE AS PREFAB
   - Drag Enemy to /Assets/Prefabs folder
   - Delete from scene


PHASE 4: WAVE SPAWNER SETUP
========================================

1. CREATE WAVE SPAWNER
   - Create empty GameObject: "WaveSpawner"
   - Add Component: Wave Spawner (script)

2. CONFIGURE WAVE SPAWNER
   - Enemy Prefab: Drag Enemy prefab from Prefabs folder
   - Player Transform: Drag Player GameObject
   - Initial Enemies Per Wave: 3
   - Enemies Increase Per Wave: 2
   - Time Between Waves: 5

TESTING
========================================

1. BASIC MOVEMENT TEST
   - Enter Play mode
   - WASD: Move around

   - Left Shift: Roll/Dodge
   - Hold Shift while moving: Sprint

2. COMBAT TEST
   - Wait for enemies to spawn (Wave 1)
   - Left Mouse Button: Attack
   - Approach enemy and attack
   - Enemy should take damage and die after ~2 hits

3. WAVE SYSTEM TEST

4. ROLL MECHANIC TEST
   - Roll while moving: Rolls in movement direction
   - Roll while standing: Rolls forward
   - You're invulnerable during roll (if enabled)
   - 1 second cooldown between rolls


TWEAKING FOR FEEL
========================================

MOVEMENT FEEL:
- PlayerController > Move Speed: Increase for faster movement
- PlayerController > Roll Speed: Adjust dodge speed
- PlayerController > Roll Duration: Shorter = snappier

COMBAT FEEL:
- PlayerCombat > Attack Range: Increase for easier hits
- PlayerCombat > Attack Damage: Balance difficulty
- EnemyAI > Move Speed: Adjust chase intensity
- EnemyAI > Attack Range: Change enemy aggression

DIFFICULTY:
- WaveSpawner > Initial Enemies Per Wave: Start easier/harder
- WaveSpawner > Enemies Increase Per Wave: Ramp up speed
- WaveSpawner > Time Between Waves: Breathing room
- PlayerHealth > Max Health: Survivability
- EnemyAI > Attack Damage: Threat level


NEXT STEPS
========================================

Once basic prototype feels good:
1. Add attack animations and effects
2. Add different enemy types
3. Add power-ups and pickups
4. Add player abilities/special attacks
5. Add visual feedback (hit effects, screen shake)
6. Add sound effects and music
7. Add game over/victory conditions
8. Add upgrade/progression system


TROUBLESHOOTING
========================================

Player not moving:
- Check Player Input component is set up correctly
- Verify InputSystem_Actions is assigned
- Check Character Controller is added

Enemies not spawning:
- Ensure Player has "Player" tag
- Check Enemy Prefab is assigned to WaveSpawner
- Verify Auto Start Waves is checked

Camera not following:
- Check Cinemachine Camera Follow/LookAt targets
- Ensure Player transform is assigned

Attacks not working:
- Verify Enemy layer is created and assigned
- Check Attack Point is positioned correctly
- Ensure Enemy Layer is selected in PlayerCombat
